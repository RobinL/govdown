# govdown

Make websites with R Markdown styled with the GOV.UK Design System.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("govdatascience/govdown")
```

## Development

Use `install-govuk-frontend.sh` to download, modify and compile the GOV.UK Design System to get the css files for the templates.

### Prerequisites

The `sassc` command-line tool.  If you can't get that to work, try the `sass`
package by RStudio, which wraps it.
